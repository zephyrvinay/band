      <p>I grew up listening to Queen's music because It was my mom's favourite band too. I remember when I was a child She used to sing to me "Love of my life" before going to bed in the night. When we were going to school and I felt sad she turned the radio on and put "Don't stop me now". That made me really happy. Most of the bands/artists I like were influeced by Queen. For example: Guns N' Roses, Bon Jovi, George Michael, etc.</p>
